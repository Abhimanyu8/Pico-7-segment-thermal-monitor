This is a quick and dirty raspberry pi pico project involving two 7-segment displays and loads of micropython.
Works as a temp indicator for PCs, Engines, Your cup of coffee.... basically anywhere you can stick the RP2040 in

Do note that the displays are connected PARALLEL-y and current is pulled straight from 5V VBUS for maximum brightness 🔆

This leads to both displays being powered at the same time and each one shows the inverse of the other . You can connect the displays
seperately but I find this wacky so it stays.
